				 Hi, I'm an undergrad student presently persuing my engineering degree with major in Computer Science & Engineering along with a minor in Big Data. Have gained industry exposure in Software Development through multiple internships. I enjoy working with other humans and am presently leading a community of 2500+ student on campus as General Secretary of the CS club of my university. I love attending and conducting tech talks, meet-ups and workshops. I also presently am the GitHub Campus Expert selected by GitHub Education for my university. Software Development, Data Structures & Algorithms, Backend Development and DevOps are some of the domains where my heart is at though I love taking up new challenges and learning new skills.

				When Iâ€™m not in front of the terminal, you can find me at the tennis court or trying out new restaurants :)
